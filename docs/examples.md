# Examples of what can happen when you don't charge your phone (lol)

- You will look up
- You will be able to see the world
- You will be able to see the world in a different way
- You will be able to see the world in a different way than you did before


# Gear to consider

- Blueparrott B650-XT (Bluetooth headset, noise cancelling - makes it easy to hear and be heard when on the road)
- Citibike subscription (for exercise and to get around the city, while you are on calls)
- A good helmet (for safety; consider the fend.io foldable helmet or the HÃ¶vding airbag helmet)
